# TCA Labour Market Analysis

The Tech Council of Australia has a goal of achieving 1 million tech sector jobs by 2025. One important
task for the data analyst at the Tech Council is to analyse labour market data to understand trends and
present insights on employment in the tech sector.

Using publicly available datasets and code written in either Python or R, construct a short analysis of the
current state of the Australian labour market that is relevant to the tech sector.

The code should perform all of the steps required in the analysis: it should download the data, clean it,
extract key insights and generate a representation of the key insight in either a table or chart.
This can take the form of a script with outputs presented in a markdown document or PDF, or a notebook
that can be viewed in the browser.

This analysis task will be assessed on the quality of insight, not the quantity of analysis. It is better to
have one killer chart, or the outputs of an interesting predictive model, rather than a large number of
descriptive statistics in a table.

You should also include a short (less than 200 words) describing the methodology and any caveats that
you have used to generate the code and analysis.

Once you have completed the code, upload it to a GitHub repository and include the link to the repository
below. Please double check once the code has been uploaded that all outputs can be viewed in the
browser.b  n
